## Our goal

The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.
When performing any action is it important to consider the impact it will have on the wellbeing of individual members and on the community as a whole, and it is important to consider your relationship to the community and how your actions may be interpreted by others.
