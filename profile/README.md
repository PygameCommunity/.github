This is the GitHub organization of Pygame Community, a dedicated online community of pygame developers, fans and users.

We develop the **[`pygame-ce`](https://www.github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce)** Python library and enhance its community by hosting exciting [**game jams**](https://itch.io/jams/hosted-by-pygame-community), creating cool community games, and more.
We provide a welcoming space to learn, master and create games with pygame, or to hang out with developers, content creators, gamers, artists, musicians, and a lot of other cool people.
