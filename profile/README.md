This is the GitHub organization of the Pygame Community Discord server, the largest dedicated online community of pygame fans and users on Discord.

We aim to enhance the community around the **[`pygame`](https://www.github.com/pygame/pygame)** Python library by hosting exciting game jams, creating cool community games, and more.
We provide a welcoming space to learn, master and create games with pygame, or to hang out with developers, content creators, gamers, artists, musicians, and a lot of other cool people.
