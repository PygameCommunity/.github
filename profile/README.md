This is the GitHub organization of Pygame Community, a dedicated online community of pygame fans and users.

We aim to enhance the community around the **[`pygame`](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce)** Python library by hosting exciting game jams, creating cool community games, and more.
We provide a welcoming space to learn, master and create games with pygame, or to hang out with developers, content creators, gamers, artists, musicians, and a lot of other cool people.
